As a proof of old-age dexerity I finally managed to connect the unused ADC-pin on ESP-01.
Suitable for TMP36GT9Z. I made tiny portable temperature sensor.
Works very well with two AAA-batteries. Found it extremely useful. As an example
the breadmaking.py keeps the dough at 37Â°C exactly with heatgun.
